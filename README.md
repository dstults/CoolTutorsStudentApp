# CoolTutorsStudentApp
 Companion App for CoolTutors.org. CoolTutors.org is a demo website hosting a teacher-student scheduling platform I'm currently working on, currently codenamed "teachersFirst". The app presently is only a browser for your personal info, that will eventually be able to do all the same features that can be found via web access, including make new appointments, cancel appointments, make new openings, cancel openings, and so on.
